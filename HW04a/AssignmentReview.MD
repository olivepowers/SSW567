### Learning Experience
When designing the code my main thought process was to make it as digestible as possible. To do so I heavily commented my code for anyone reading it to have some understanding of what is being done. When it came to write my test cases I wanted to test every input that I thought could be passed in. This meant trying tests that I knew would fail and pass. For the tests that would pass I gave two valid usernames and ensured their output was valid. As for the test cases that I knew would not pass I figured that invalid usernames would need to be looked into. I did so passing in a string and integer invalid username. Both were properly caught and the integer passed in was able to be caught as I converted anything input to the function to a String. I found my test cases covered all bases and proved the implementation was solid.
